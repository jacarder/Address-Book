# AddressBook

Project that uses Angular and Akita state management. Was looking to get some more practice with Akita and decided this would be a great opportunity to do so.

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

# Summary

I decided to utilize [Akita](https://datorama.github.io/akita/) and alternative to using NgRx. After having some time with NgRx, I said enough was enough. We know that state management should be used only when needed and this project may have been overkill, but it's the concepts that matter. I also wanted to give [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) a try again. Even after this I still feel Angular Material is limiting and that there are better packages to choose from.

## Overall view of my process:
- Decide packages 
- Scaffold some of the component in mind
- Impliment the pages
- Final touches

## Features
- Akita state management
-- Address book state
-- Search filter state
- Dynamic Search
- Angular Material

## Given more time I would have liked to have completed: 
- Use something other than Angular Material—just too limiting. The time to take to change would be significant since I would have to go through the HTML and remove and redo the CSS—no more than a couple hours. 
- Pagination would've been neat—especially with state management—not long to implement.
- Most of these wouldn't take too much time, but it's all relative isn't it.

## Given more time to make the app more robust I would've:
- Added admin page to add, update, and remove entries. Not too much time, but most certainly more than a day.
-- Create a backend to see the results based on the actions above. Would take time to set up a back end server and database. More than a day.
- Authentication. Another great benefit with state management. Couple of hours
- Animation to help with change blindness. More than a day depending on how fancy.
